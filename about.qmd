- business registration  
- financial reporting  
- public accountants  
- corporate service providers  

In addition to its regulatory responsibilities, ACRA also plays a key role as a **facilitator** in the development of business entities and the *public accountancy profession* in Singapore.

### Purpose of Internship

The primary purpose of my internship is to **gain practical work experience** in a professional environment. As many *data analysts* need to determine which sector they would like to work in, this internship provides me with valuable exposure to what it is like to work as a **data analyst in both the accounting industry and the public sector**.

### Department and Project Involvement

I am attached to the **Financial Reporting and Information Department**, which is responsible for administering the **Financial Reporting Surveillance Programme (FRSP)**. Under the FRSP, selected *financial statements* filed with ACRA are reviewed to assess their **compliance with prescribed accounting standards in Singapore**.

To support the objective of *improving the quality of financial reporting*, the department initiated a **risk profiling project** aimed at identifying **high-risk companies**.

### Internship Experience and Contributions

During my internship, I participated in this key project by analysing **financial data** using a combination of *machine learning techniques* and **accounting rules** to identify companies operating in high-risk areas.

In addition to project work, I was also involved in **operational tasks** related to the collection and processing of financial data, which helped to *ease the workload* of the department.
