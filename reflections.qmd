title: "Reflection on the use of GenAI"
---

## Introduction

In this assessment, I used Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools to support my learning, content creation, and problem-solving process. GenAI was used as a supplementary aid rather than a replacement for my own understanding and effort.

---

## GenAI Tool Used and Reason for Selection

The primary GenAI tool I used was **ChatGPT**. I chose this tool because it is easily accessible, provides clear explanations, and is effective in breaking down complex technical concepts into understandable steps. It was particularly useful for learning-related tasks and iterative refinement of ideas.

## How GenAI Helped in Completing the Assessment

GenAI assisted me in several ways throughout the assessment:

- **Clarifying concepts:** When I encountered unfamiliar or confusing topics, GenAI helped explain them in simpler terms, allowing me to grasp the underlying logic more quickly.
- **Structuring content:** The tool helped me organise my thoughts and structure written content more clearly, especially when drafting explanations and reflections.
- **Debugging and improvement:** GenAI was useful in identifying errors and suggesting improvements in code or formatting, which helped me resolve issues more efficiently.
- **Guidance rather than answers:** Instead of providing direct solutions, the tool often guided me step-by-step, encouraging independent thinking.

## Benefits of Using GenAI

The key benefits of using GenAI include:

- Improved efficiency when researching or troubleshooting
- Clear and concise explanations tailored to my level of understanding
- Immediate feedback and suggestions for improvement
- Support for independent learning outside of classroom hours

---

## Challenges and Limitations

Despite its usefulness, GenAI also has limitations:

- The output may sometimes be too generic and requires critical evaluation
- There is a risk of over-reliance if the user does not actively engage with the material
- Not all generated information is guaranteed to be fully accurate, so verification is necessary

These limitations highlighted the importance of using GenAI responsibly and critically.

## Future Use of GenAI in Study and Work

In the future, I believe GenAI tools will continue to assist me in both academic and professional settings. They can be useful for learning new technologies, drafting documentation, brainstorming ideas, and improving productivity. However, I will continue to rely on my own understanding and judgement as the primary source of decision-making.

## Conclusion

Overall, GenAI was a valuable learning support tool during this assessment. When used responsibly, it enhanced my understanding, efficiency, and confidence without replacing independent effort or critical thinking.
