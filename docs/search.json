    "text": "The organization that I am doing my internship with is Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA). ACRA is a statutory board under the Ministry of Finance. It is the regulator of business registration, financial reporting, public accountants and corporate service providers. It also plays the role of a facilitator for the development of business entities and the public accountancy profession.\nACRA is responsible for carrying out the following functions:\n\nTo administer the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority Act 2004, the Accountants Act 2004, the Business Names Registration Act 2014, the Companies Act 1967, the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2005, the Limited Partnerships Act 2008 and the Variable Capital Companies Act 2018\nTo report and make recommendations to, and advise the Government on matters relating to the registration and regulation of business entities, public accountants, and corporate service providers\nTo establish and administer a repository of documents and information relating to business entities, public accountants, and corporate service providers and to provide access to the public to such documents and information\nTo represent the Government internationally in matters relating to the registration and regulation of business entities, public accountants, and corporate service providers\nTo promote public awareness about new business structures, compliance requirements, corporate governance practice and any matter under the purview of the Authority\n\nThe purpose of my internship is to allow me to gain work experience in a professional environment. Knowing that most data analysts will need to figure out which sector they would like to work in, it gives me a chance to experience how it is like to be a data analyst in the accounting industry and in the public sector.\nThe department that I am attached to is called the Financial Reporting and Information Department. It is responsible for administering the Financial Reporting Surveillance Programme (FRSP). Under the FRSP, selected financial statements (FS) filed with ACRA are reviewed for compliance with the prescribed accounting standards in Singapore. To achieve the objective of improving the quality of financial reporting, the department embarked on a project to identify high-risk companies, i.e. risk profiling project.\nThis internship allows me to participate in this key project which focuses on identifying companies in certain high-risk areas through the use of financial data with the help of machine learning and accounting rules. As the department is also responsible for the collection of financial data from companies, I was also involved in some operational work to ease the workload of the department.\nMain Tasks done through my internship at ACRA:"
