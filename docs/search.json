It is responsible for administering the Financial Reporting Surveillance Programme (FRSP). Under the FRSP, selected financial statements (FS) filed with ACRA are reviewed for compliance with the prescribed accounting standards in Singapore. To achieve the objective of improving the quality of financial reporting, the department embarked on a project to identify high-risk companies, i.e. risk profiling project.\nThis internship allows me to participate in this key project which focuses on identifying companies in certain high-risk areas through the use of financial data with the help of machine learning and accounting rules. As the department is also responsible for the collection of financial data from companies, I was also involved in some operational work to ease the workload of the department.\nMain Tasks done through my internship at ACRA:"
